---GAME DESCRIPTION: An arkanoid-style 1-level game. This game was created in the context of the weekly programming assignments for "Intermediate Object-Oriented Programming for Unity Games" Course (University of Colorado System) hosted by Coursera.org, purely for educational purposes, in December 2018.

---ART: Brick, ball and paddle art is borrowed for the original "Arkanoid" game released in 1985 by Taito.

---MUSIC: Most SFX are also borrowed from the original "Arkanoid" game. Main Menu's music theme is borrowed from the "Terra Cresta" game, released in 1985 by Nichibutsu.

---CONTROLS: If you want to play the game rather than just sit there and watch the screen, you may do so with the Arrow Keys, obviously. What did you expect? It's a classic retro game, after all!
